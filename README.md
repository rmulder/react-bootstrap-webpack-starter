### ReactJS + Bootstrap starter with hot reload

#### Full client and server side in ES6+-ES2015+

_Concept behind:_ **this starter is an easy way to understand and ready to use ReactJS (ES6) + bootstrap + webpack starter with:**

* `no hard core Webpack` config so it is more commonly understandable (_they are numerous amazing starters with incredible webpack configs — hard core configs aren't bad things at all! —. This one is just for easier understanding for people even discovering webpack_)
* `with hot reload` (_ReactJS + webpack => hot reload = WINNER_)
* `no flux` (_yes, to give you freedom to add then since you may want to use something else like observables?_)
* `with JWT auth`
* _ReactJS Components written with `optimization tricks` (stateless, pure render...)._

## Breaking changes since v6.1.0

* add `React 16.3.x` new context API use case (*you may no more need redux*)
* migrated to bootstrap 4

## Breaking changes since v6.0.0

* upgrade to `React 16.3.x`
* upgrade to `webpack 4`
* upgrade to `react-hot-loader v4`
* drop `CSS Module` in favor of `styled-components` (_scoped style, theme support, better scaling in huge applications, simplify toolchain and keep nearly SASS syntax_)
* add `flow types` (*even a little typing at least for better dev experience*)
* drop `prop-types`(*static and dynamic typing apart, flow type does far more so avoid writing 2 differents typing system*)
* `workbox-webpack-plugin` (_service worker caching powerful tool from Google_)
* [loadable-components](https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components) (_split your code: here splitted just by routes, by you can split a component level if you feel the need_)
* `webpack-bundle-analyzer`: analyze your bundle size (_maybe you should split or lazy load some part of your application: you will see clearly how to fix that_)
* drop `moment` for `date-fns` (*since far smaller size and job's done*)

## Breaking changes since v5.0.0

* upgrade to React 16.x
* `react-router 4+` (_read this [nice article about migrating from react-router 3 to react-router 4](https://codeburst.io/react-router-v4-unofficial-migration-guide-5a370b8905a)_)
* add few flow types (_still keep propTypes_)
* updated hot reload (_[read hot reload starter](https://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/getstarted/)_)
* use `CSS module` (_keep coding style with SASS but get benefit of css module for a more peasant coding_)

## HUGE Breaking changes since 3.0.0

* upgrade to `React 15.6.x`
* upgrade to `webpack v3`
* add `JWT authentication` (protected route, logout components...)

## HUGE Breaking changes since 2.1.0

* upgrade to `react-router v4`

## HUGE Breaking changes since 2.0.0

* upgrade to `webpack 2`
* remove autoprefixer in favor of `postcss` and `cssnext`
* upgrade `React` to `15.5.4+`
* `PropTypes` comes now from `prop-types`
* upgrade dependencies

> If you prefer a `webpack 1` version, [version 1.1.0](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-bootstrap-webpack-starter/tree/v1.1.0) is what you are looking for.
